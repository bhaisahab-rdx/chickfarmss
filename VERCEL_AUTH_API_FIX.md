# ChickFarms Authentication API Fix for Vercel Deployment

This fix addresses the issue of authentication not working when the ChickFarms app is deployed to Vercel. The problem was related to how Vercel routes API requests and how authentication endpoints were being handled.

## What Was Fixed

### 1. Authentication Routes in Consolidated API

The consolidated API handler (`api/consolidated.js`) now includes direct support for authentication endpoints:
- `/api/login` - For user login
- `/api/register` - For user registration
- `/api/logout` - For user logout
- `/api/user` - For retrieving the current user

This means all authentication requests will be handled by the consolidated API function without requiring additional serverless functions.

### 2. Session-Based Authentication

The authentication implementation provides a simplified session-based authentication system:
- Creates and validates session tokens
- Handles user creation and verification
- Manages sessions via cookies
- Validates passwords securely

### 3. Route Configuration in Vercel.json

The `vercel.json` file has been updated to explicitly route authentication endpoints to the consolidated API:
```json
{
  "routes": [
    { "src": "/api/auth/(.*)", "dest": "/api/consolidated.js" },
    { "src": "/api/user", "dest": "/api/consolidated.js" },
    { "src": "/api/login", "dest": "/api/consolidated.js" },
    { "src": "/api/register", "dest": "/api/consolidated.js" },
    { "src": "/api/logout", "dest": "/api/consolidated.js" },
    // ... other routes
  ]
}
```

## How It Works

1. When a request comes to `/api/login`, `/api/register`, `/api/logout`, or `/api/user`, Vercel routes it to the consolidated API
2. The consolidated API identifies the authentication-related path
3. It handles the request with the appropriate authentication function
4. The function interacts directly with the database for authentication
5. Sessions are maintained with secure cookies

## Benefits

- **Reduced Function Count**: All authentication is handled by a single serverless function
- **Compatible API**: The API endpoints remain the same, so no client-side changes are needed
- **Secure Authentication**: Passwords are properly hashed and validated
- **Session Management**: Sessions are properly maintained
- **Simplified Deployment**: No need for additional authentication-specific functions

## Next Steps

1. Deploy your application to Vercel using the standard deployment process
2. Test authentication by logging in and verifying that you can access authenticated endpoints
3. Test the user registration flow to ensure new users can be created
4. Verify that logout properly clears sessions
