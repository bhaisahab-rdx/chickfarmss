# Solving Vercel Hobby Plan Function Limit

## The Problem

Your Vercel deployment was failing with this error:

```
Error: No more than 12 Serverless Functions can be added to a Deployment on the Hobby plan. 
Create a team (Pro plan) to deploy more. Learn More: https://vercel.link/function-count-limit
```

Vercel's Hobby plan has a limit of 12 serverless functions per deployment. Each JavaScript file in your `/api` directory becomes a separate serverless function.

## The Solution

We've solved this without requiring a plan upgrade by consolidating multiple API endpoints into a single serverless function:

### 1. Created a Consolidated API Handler

The file `api/consolidated.js` now contains the functionality of multiple API endpoints:
- health
- minimal
- diagnostics
- env-test
- db-test
- test-deployment

This combined endpoint uses path-based routing to determine which functionality to execute based on the requested URL.

### 2. Updated Route Configuration

We've updated `vercel.json` to route multiple API paths to the same consolidated handler:

```json
"routes": [
  { "src": "/api/test-deployment", "dest": "/api/consolidated.js" },
  { "src": "/api/env-test", "dest": "/api/consolidated.js" },
  { "src": "/api/health", "dest": "/api/consolidated.js" },
  { "src": "/api/minimal", "dest": "/api/consolidated.js" },
  { "src": "/api/diagnostics", "dest": "/api/consolidated.js" },
  { "src": "/api/db-test", "dest": "/api/consolidated.js" },
  { "src": "/health", "dest": "/api/consolidated.js" },
  ...
]
```

## Benefits

1. **Stay within the Hobby plan limits**: Reduce the number of serverless functions without losing functionality
2. **No cost increase**: Avoid upgrading to the Pro plan
3. **No functional changes**: All API endpoints continue to work as before

## Next Steps

1. **Push these changes to your repository**
2. **Deploy to Vercel again**
3. **Check the Vercel logs** to ensure the deployment succeeds without the function limit error
4. **Test your application** to ensure all functionality still works as expected

## Monitoring and Future Considerations

As your application grows, keep track of the number of API endpoints you add. If you continue to add more functionality, you may need to:

1. Further consolidate API endpoints into logical groups
2. Consider upgrading to the Pro plan if consolidation becomes too complex

The new consolidated API handler is designed to be extensible - you can add more endpoint handlers to it as needed.
