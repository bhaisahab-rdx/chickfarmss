# ChickFarms Vercel 404 Error Fix Guide

This guide provides instructions for fixing the 404 errors in your Vercel deployment.

## What Was Fixed

The following issues have been addressed:

1. **Route Configuration**: Fixed route ordering in vercel.json to ensure proper API endpoint routing
2. **API Function Consolidation**: Improved how API functions are consolidated to stay within Vercel's function limits
3. **Vercel Output Structure**: Enhanced the output structure configuration for better deployment compatibility
4. **Environment Variables**: Ensured proper propagation of environment variables to the Vercel deployment

## Deployment Steps

Follow these steps to deploy your fixed application to Vercel:

### 1. Prepare the Application

Run the build script to prepare your application for Vercel deployment:

```bash
node build-vercel.js
```

This script will:
- Update all imports to include .js extensions for ESM compatibility
- Set up API endpoints for Vercel
- Validate and fix the vercel.json configuration
- Create a manual Vercel output structure with a single API function

### 2. Deploy to Vercel

#### Option 1: Using Vercel Dashboard
1. Import your GitHub repository into the Vercel Dashboard
2. Use the following settings:
   - Framework Preset: Other
   - Build Command: `node build-vercel.js && npm run build`
   - Output Directory: `dist`
   - Development Command: (leave blank)

#### Option 2: Using Vercel CLI
1. Install Vercel CLI: `npm i -g vercel`
2. Login to Vercel: `vercel login`
3. Deploy the project: `vercel`

### 3. Verify the Deployment

After deployment, verify that the application is working by:

1. Visiting the main page of your application
2. Testing the API endpoints:
   - `/api/vercel-debug`: Should show debug information about the environment
   - `/api/health`: Should show health status
   - `/api/spin/status`: Should show spin status (requires authentication)

## Troubleshooting

If you still encounter 404 errors:

1. **Check Function Logs**: In the Vercel Dashboard, go to the Functions tab to view logs for API calls
2. **Verify Environment Variables**: Ensure all required environment variables are set in Vercel
3. **Check Deployment Settings**: Make sure the build command and output directory are correctly configured
4. **Test Debug Endpoints**: Use the `/api/vercel-debug` endpoint to get diagnostic information

## Important Routes to Test

After deployment, test these critical routes:

1. **Main Application**: `/`
2. **API Health**: `/api/health`
3. **Vercel Debug**: `/api/vercel-debug`
4. **Spin Debug**: `/api/debug-spin`
5. **Spin Status** (requires auth): `/api/spin/status`
6. **Authentication** (requires login): `/api/auth/login`

## Additional Notes

- The Vercel deployment uses a single consolidated API function for all backend endpoints
- This approach helps stay within the 12-function limit of Vercel's hobby plan
- All API routes are mapped through a routing layer in the consolidated.cjs file
