# HTML Game Removal Notes

This document outlines the changes made to remove the simplified HTML game version from the Vercel deployment, ensuring that only the full React application is deployed.

## Changes Made

1. **Modified `vercel-api-build.js`**
   - Removed the code that created a root index.html file with redirection
   - Added code to actively remove any existing index.html file to prevent confusion
   - This ensures the React app is served directly without HTML-based fallbacks

2. **Updated `.vercelignore`**
   - Added `public/*.html` to the ignore list
   - This prevents any HTML files in the public directory from being included in the Vercel deployment
   - The HTML game files (game.html, login.html, register.html, etc.) will be excluded from deployment

3. **Updated Documentation**
   - Added clear notes to VERCEL_FULL_REACT_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md
   - Added notes to VERCEL_DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md
   - Created this specific document to track HTML game removal changes

## HTML Files Excluded

The following HTML files will be excluded from the deployment:
- public/index.html
- public/game.html
- public/login.html
- public/register.html
- public/health.html
- public/vercel-test.html

## Verification Process

To verify that only the React application is being deployed:

1. Deploy to Vercel using the updated configuration
2. Test the following paths to ensure they all serve the React application:
   - /
   - /login
   - /register
   - /game
3. Inspect network requests to confirm no HTML files from the public directory are loaded
4. Verify that authentication and all game features work correctly in the React app

## Rollback (If Needed)

If you need to revert these changes for any reason:

1. Remove the `public/*.html` entry from .vercelignore
2. Restore the original code in vercel-api-build.js that creates the root index.html file
3. Update the documentation to reflect that both versions are available

However, it's recommended to maintain this configuration to ensure a consistent user experience with only the full-featured React application.
