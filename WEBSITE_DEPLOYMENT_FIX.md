# ChickFarms Website Deployment Fix

## Problem Solved: 404 Error on Main Website

We've fixed the issue where users were getting a 404 error when trying to access the main application at:
```
https://chickfarmss-wqo7.vercel.app/dist/public/index.html
```

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Fixed Routing Configuration

We've updated the routing in `vercel.json` to properly handle all paths:

- Added direct routes for `/index.html` and `/dist/public/index.html`
- Used simplified wildcard pattern for all API requests
- Ensured all frontend routes correctly resolve to the main application

### 2. Updated Index File

The root `index.html` file was previously trying to redirect to `/dist/public/index.html`, causing a redirect loop. We've fixed this by:

- Replacing the redirect index with the actual application HTML
- Including all necessary styles and scripts
- Ensuring proper asset paths

### 3. Simplified Asset Handling

We've streamlined the way static assets are served:

- All static files (JS, CSS, images) are correctly routed from the assets directory
- The SPA routing now works properly for all application paths

## How to Test

1. **Access the main website**:
   - https://chickfarmss-wqo7.vercel.app/

2. **Test these alternate routes** (all should work):
   - https://chickfarmss-wqo7.vercel.app/index.html
   - https://chickfarmss-wqo7.vercel.app/dist/public/index.html
   - https://chickfarmss-wqo7.vercel.app/any/deep/path (SPA routing)

3. **Verify API endpoints** continue to work:
   - https://chickfarmss-wqo7.vercel.app/api/health
   - https://chickfarmss-wqo7.vercel.app/api/diagnostics
